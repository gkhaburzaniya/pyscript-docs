# Builtin helpers

PyScript makes available convenience objects, functions and attributes.

In Python this is done via the `pyscript` module:

```python title="Accessing the document object via the pyscript module"
from pyscript import document
```

In HTML this is done via `py-*` and `mpy-*` attributes (depending on the
interpreter you're using):

```html title="An example of a py-click handler"
<button id="foo" py-click="handler_defined_in_python">Click me</button>
```

## Common features

These Python objects / functions are available in both the main thread and in
code running on a web worker:

### `pyscript.window`

On the main thread, this object is exactly the same as `import js` which, in
turn, is a proxy of JavaScript's
[globalThis](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/globalThis)
object.

On a worker thread, this object is a proxy for the web page's
[global window context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window).

!!! warning

    The reference for `pyscript.window` is **always** a reference to the main
    thread's global window context.

    If you're running code in a worker this is **not the worker's own global
    context**. A worker's global context is always reachable via `import js`
    (the `js` object being a proxy for the worker's `globalThis`).

### `pyscript.document`

On both main and worker threads, this object is a proxy for the web page's
[document object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document).
The `document` is a representation of the
[DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_object_model/Using_the_Document_Object_Model)
and can be used to read or manipulate the content of the web page.

### `pyscript.display`

A function used to display content. The function is intelligent enough to
introspect the object[s] it is passed and work out how to correctly display the
object[s] in the web page based on the following mime types:

* `text/plain` to show the content as text
* `text/html` to show the content as *HTML*
* `image/png` to show the content as `<img>`
* `image/jpeg` to show the content as `<img>`
* `image/svg+xml` to show the content as `<svg>`
* `application/json` to show the content as *JSON*
* `application/javascript` to put the content in `<script>` (discouraged)

The `display` function takes a list of `*values` as its first argument, and has
two optional named arguments:

* `target=None` - the DOM element into which the content should be placed.
  If not specified, the `target` will use the `current_script()` returned id
  and populate the related dedicated node to show the content.
* `append=True` - a flag to indicate if the output is going to be appended to
  the `target`.

There are some caveats:

* When used in the main thread, the `display` function automatically uses
  the current `<py-script>` or `<mpy-script>` tag as the `target` into which
  the content will be displayed.
* If the `<script>` tag has the `target` attribute, and is not a worker,
  the element on the page with that ID (or which matches that selector)
  will be used to display the content instead.
* When used in a worker, the `display` function needs an explicit
  `target="dom-id"` argument to identify where the content will be
  displayed.
* In both the main thread and worker, `append=True` is the default
  behaviour.


```html title="Various display examples"
<!-- will produce
    <py-script>PyScript</py-script>
-->
<py-script worker>
    from pyscript import display
    display("PyScript", append=False)
</py-script>

<!-- will produce
    <script type="py">...</script>
    <script-py>PyScript</script-py>
-->
<script type="py">
    from pyscript import display
    display("PyScript", append=False)
</script>

<!-- will populate <h1>PyScript</h1> -->
<script type="py" target="my-h1">
    from pyscript import display
    display("PyScript", append=False)
</script>
<h1 id="my-h1"></h1>

<!-- will populate <h2>PyScript</h2> -->
<script type="py" worker>
    from pyscript import display
    display("PyScript", target="my-h2", append=False)
</script>
<h2 id="my-h2"></h2>
```

### `pyscript.when`

A Python decorator to indicate the decorated function should handle the
specified events for selected elements.

The decorator takes two parameters:

* The `event_type` should be the name of the
  [browser event to handle](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events)
  as a string (e.g. `"click"`).
* The `selector` should be a string containing a
  [valid selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_object_model/Locating_DOM_elements_using_selectors)
  to indicate the target elements in the DOM whose events of `event_type` are
  of interest.

The following example has a button with an id of `my_button` and a decorated
function that handles `click` events dispatched by the button.

```html title="The HTML button"
<button id="my_button">Click me!</button>
```

```python title="The decorated Python function to handle click events"
from pyscript import when, display


@when("click", "#my_button")
def click_handler(event):
    """
    Event handlers get an event object representing the activity that raised
    them.
    """
    display("I've been clicked!")
```

This functionality is related to the `py-*` or `mpy-*` [HTML attributes](#html-attributes).

### `pyscript.js_modules`

It is possible to [define JavaScript modules to use within your Python code](configuration.md#javascript-modules).

Such named modules will always then be available under the
`pyscript.js_modules` namespace.

!!! warning

    Please see the documentation (linked above) about restrictions and gotchas
    when configuring how JavaScript modules are made available to PyScript.

### `pyscript.fetch`

A common task is to `fetch` data from the web via HTTP requests. The
`pyscript.fetch` function provides a uniform way to achieve this in both
Pyodide and MicroPython. It is closely modelled on the
[Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) found
in browsers with some important Pythonic differences.

The simple use case is to pass in a URL and `await` the response. Remember, in
order to use `await` you must have the `async` attribute in the `script` tag
that references your code. If this request is in a function, that function
should also be defined as `async`.

```python title="A simple HTTP GET with pyscript.fetch"
from pyscript import fetch


response = await fetch("https://example.com")
if response.ok:
    data = await response.text()
else:
    print(response.status)
```

The object returned from an `await fetch` call will have attributes that
correspond to the
[JavaScript response object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response).
This is useful for getting response codes, headers and other metadata before
processing the response's data.

Alternatively, rather than using a double `await` (one to get the response, the
other to grab the data), it's possible to chain the calls into a single
`await` like this:

```python title="A simple HTTP GET as a single await"
from pyscript import fetch

data = await fetch("https://example.com").text()
```

The following awaitable methods are available to you to access the data
returned from the server:

* `arrayBuffer()` returns a Python
  [memoryview](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#memoryview) of
  the response. This is equivalent to the
  [`arrayBuffer()` method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/arrayBuffer)
  in the browser based `fetch` API.
* `blob()` returns a JavaScript
  [`blob`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/blob)
  version of the response. This is equivalent to the
  [`blob()` method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/blob)
  in the browser based `fetch` API.
* `bytearray()` returns a Python
  [`bytearray`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytearray)
  version of the response.
* `json()` returns a Python datastructure representing a JSON serialised
  payload in the response.
* `text()` returns a Python string version of the response.

The underlying browser `fetch` API has
[many request options](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch#supplying_request_options)
that you should pass in as keyword arguments like this:

```python title="Supplying request options."
from pyscript import fetch


result = await fetch("https://example.com", method="POST", body="HELLO").text()
```

!!! Danger

    You may encounter
    [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CORS)
    errors (especially with reference to a missing
    [Access-Control-Allow-Origin header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS/Errors/CORSMissingAllowOrigin).

    This is a security feature of modern browsers where the site to which you
    are making a request **will not process a request from a site hosted at
    another domain**.

    For example, if your PyScript app is hosted under `example.com` and you
    make a request to `bbc.co.uk` (who don't allow requests from other domains)
    then you'll encounter this sort of CORS related error.

    There is nothing PyScript can do about this problem (it's a feature, not a
    bug). However, you could use a pass-through proxy service to get around
    this limitation (i.e. the proxy service makes the call on your behalf).

### `pyscript.WebSocket`

If a `pyscript.fetch` results in a call and response HTTP interaction with a
web server, the `pyscript.Websocket` class provides a way to use
[websockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API)
for two-way sending and receiving of data via a long term connection with a
web server.

PyScript's implementation, available in both the main thread and a web worker,
closely follows the browser's own 
[WebSocket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket) class.

This class accepts the following named arguments:

* A `url` pointing at the _ws_ or _wss_ address. E.g.:
  `WebSocket(url="ws://localhost:5037/")`
* Some `protocols`, an optional string or a list of strings as
  [described here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket/WebSocket#parameters).

The `WebSocket` class also provides these convenient static constants:

* `WebSocket.CONNECTING` (`0`) - the `ws.readyState` value when a web socket
  has just been created.
* `WebSocket.OPEN` (`1`) - the `ws.readyState` value once the socket is open.
* `WebSocket.CLOSING` (`2`) - the `ws.readyState` after `ws.close()` is
  explicitly invoked to stop the connection.
* `WebSocket.CLOSED` (`3`) - the `ws.readyState` once closed.

A `WebSocket` instance has only 2 methods:

* `ws.send(data)` - where `data` is either a string or a Python buffer,
  automatically converted into a JavaScript typed array. This sends data via
  the socket to the connected web server.
* `ws.close(code=0, reason="because")` - which optionally accepts `code` and
  `reason` as named arguments to signal some specific status or cause for
  closing the web socket. Otherwise `ws.close()` works with the default
  standard values.

A `WebSocket` instance also has the fields that the JavaScript
`WebSocket` instance will have:

* [binaryType](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket/binaryType) -
  the type of binary data being received over the WebSocket connection.
* [bufferedAmount](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket/bufferedAmount) -
  a read-only property that returns the number of bytes of data that have been
  queued using calls to `send()` but not yet transmitted to the network.
* [extensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket/extensions) -
  a read-only property that returns the extensions selected by the server.
* [protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket/protocol) -
  a read-only property that returns the name of the sub-protocol the server
  selected.
* [readyState](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket/readyState) -
  a read-only property that returns the current state of the WebSocket
  connection as one of the `WebSocket` static constants (`CONNECTING`, `OPEN`,
  etc...).
* [url](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket/url) -
  a read-only property that returns the absolute URL of the `WebSocket`
  instance.

A `WebSocket` instance can have the following listeners. Directly attach
handler functions to them. Such functions will always receive a single
`event` object.

* [onclose](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket/close_event) -
  fired when the `WebSocket`'s connection is closed.
* [onerror](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket/error_event) -
  fired when the connection is closed due to an error.
* [onmessage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket/message_event) -
  fired when data is received via the `WebSocket`. If the `event.data` is a
  JavaScript typed array instead of a string, the reference it will point
  directly to a _memoryview_ of the underlying `bytearray` data.
* [onopen](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket/open_event) -
  fired when the connection is opened.

The following code demonstrates a `pyscript.WebSocket` in action.

```html
<script type="mpy" worker>
    from pyscript import WebSocket

    def onopen(event):
        print(event.type)
        ws.send("hello")

    def onmessage(event):
        print(event.type, event.data)
        ws.close()

    def onclose(event):
        print(event.type)

    ws = WebSocket(url="ws://localhost:5037/")
    ws.onopen = onopen
    ws.onmessage = onmessage
    ws.onclose = onclose
</script>
```

!!! info

    It's also possible to pass in any handler functions as named arguments when
    you instantiate the `pyscript.WebSocket` class:

    ```python
    from pyscript import WebSocket


    def onmessage(event):
        print(event.type, event.data)
        ws.close()


    ws = WebSocket(url="ws://example.com/socket", onmessage=onmessage)
    ```

### `pyscript.ffi.to_js`

A utility function to convert Python references into their JavaScript
equivalents. For example, a Python dictionary is converted into a JavaScript
object literal (rather than a JavaScript `Map`), unless a `dict_converter`
is explicitly specified and the runtime is Pyodide.

The technical details of how this works are [described here](../ffi#to_js).

### `pyscript.ffi.create_proxy`

A utility function explicitly for when a callback function is added via an
event listener. It ensures the function still exists beyond the assignment of
the function to an event. Should you not `create_proxy` around the callback
function, it will be immediately garbage collected after being bound to the
event.

!!! warning

    There is some technical complexity to this situation, and we have attempted
    to create a mechanism where `create_proxy` is never needed.

    *Pyodide* expects the created proxy to be explicitly destroyed when it's
    not needed / used anymore. However, the underlying `proxy.destroy()` method
    has not been implemented in *MicroPython* (yet).

    To simplify this situation and automatically destroy proxies based on
    JavaScript memory management (garbage collection) heuristics, we have
    introduced an **experimental flag**:

    ```toml
    experimental_create_proxy = "auto"
    ```

    This flag ensures the proxy creation and destruction process is managed for
    you. When using this flag you should never need to explicitly call
    `create_proxy`.

The technical details of how this works are
[described here](../ffi#create_proxy).

### `pyscript.current_target`

A utility function to retrieve the unique identifier of the element used
to display content. If the element is not a `<script>` and it already has
an `id`, that `id` will be returned.

```html title="The current_target utility"
<!-- current_target(): explicit-id -->
<mpy-script id="explicit-id">
    from pyscript import display, current_target
    display(f"current_target(): {current_target()}")
</mpy-script>

<!-- current_target(): mpy-0 -->
<mpy-script>
    from pyscript import display, current_target
    display(f"current_target(): {current_target()}")
</mpy-script>

<!-- current_target(): mpy-1 -->
<!-- creates right after the <script>:
    <script-py id="mpy-1">
        <div>current_target(): mpy-1</div>
    </script-py>
-->
<script type="mpy">
    from pyscript import display, current_target
    display(f"current_target(): {current_target()}")
</script>
```

!!! Note

    The return value of `current_target()` always references a visible element
    on the page, **not** at the current `<script>` that is executing the code.

    To reference the `<script>` element executing the code, assign it an `id`:

    ```html
    <script type="mpy" id="unique-id">...</script>
    ```

    Then use the standard `document.getElementById(script_id)` function to
    return a reference to it in your code.

### `pyscript.config`

A Python dictionary representing the configuration for the interpreter.

```python title="Reading the current configuration."
from pyscript import config


# It's just a dict.
print(config.get("files"))
```

!!! warning

    Changing the `config` dictionary at runtime has no effect on the actual
    configuration.

    It's just a convenience to **read the configuration** at run time.

### `pyscript.HTML`

A class to wrap generic content and display it as un-escaped HTML on the page.

```html title="The HTML class"
<script type="mpy">
    from pyscript import display, HTML

    # Escaped by default:
    display("<em>em</em>")  # &lt;em&gt;em&lt;/em&gt;
</script>

<script type="mpy">
    from pyscript import display, HTML

    # Un-escaped raw content inserted into the page:
    display(HTML("<em>em</em>"))  # <em>em</em>
</script>
```

### `pyscript.RUNNING_IN_WORKER`

This constant flag is `True` when the current code is running within a
*worker*. It is `False` when the code is running within the *main* thread.

## Main-thread only features

### `pyscript.PyWorker`

A class used to instantiate a new worker from within Python.

!!! Note

    Sometimes we disambiguate between interpreters through naming conventions
    (e.g. `py` or `mpy`).

    However, this class is always `PyWorker` and **the desired interpreter 
    MUST be specified via a `type` option**. Valid values for the type of
    interpreter are either `micropython` or `pyodide`.

The following fragments demonstrate how to evaluate the file `worker.py` on a
new worker from within Python.

```python title="worker.py - the file to run in the worker."
from pyscript import RUNNING_IN_WORKER, display, sync

display("Hello World", target="output", append=True)

# will log into devtools console
print(RUNNING_IN_WORKER)  # True
print("sleeping")
sync.sleep(1)
print("awake")
```

```python title="main.py - starts a new worker in Python."
from pyscript import PyWorker

# type MUST be either `micropython` or `pyodide`
PyWorker("worker.py", type="micropython")
```

```html title="The HTML context for the worker."
<script type="mpy" src="./main.py">
<div id="output"></div>  <!-- The display target -->
```

## Worker only features

### `pyscript.sync`

A function used to pass serializable data from workers to the main thread. 

Imagine you have this code on the main thread:

```python title="Python code on the main thread"
from pyscript import PyWorker

def hello(name="world"):
    display(f"Hello, {name}")

worker = PyWorker("./worker.py")
worker.sync.hello = hello
```

In the code on the worker, you can pass data back to handler functions like
this:

```python title="Pass data back to the main thread from a worker"
from pyscript import sync

sync.hello("PyScript")
```

### `pyscript.py_import`

!!! warning

    **This is an experimental feature.**

    Feedback and bug reports are welcome!

If you have a lot of Python packages referenced in your configuration, startup
performance may be degraded as these are downloaded.

If a Python package is only needed under certain circumstances, we provide an
asynchronous way to import packages that were not originally referenced in your
configuration.

```html title="A pyscript.py_import example."
<script type="py" async>
from pyscript import py_import

matplotlib, regex, = await py_import("matplotlib", "regex")

print(matplotlib, regex)
</script>
```

The `py_import` call returns an asynchronous tuple containing the Python
modules provided by the packages referenced as string arguments.

### `pyscript.js_import`

If a JavaScript module is only needed under certain circumstances, we provide
an asynchronous way to import packages that were not originally referenced in
your configuration.

```html title="A pyscript.js_import example."
<script type="py" async>
from pyscript import js_import, window

escaper, = await js_import("https://esm.run/html-escaper")

window.console.log(escaper)
```

The `js_import` call returns an asynchronous tuple containing the JavaScript
modules referenced as string arguments.

## HTML attributes

As a convenience, and to ensure backwards compatibility, PyScript allows the
use of inline event handlers via custom HTML attributes.

!!! warning

    This classic pattern of coding (inline event handlers) is no longer
    considered good practice in web development circles.

    We include this behaviour for historic reasons, but the folks at
    Mozilla [have a good explanation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events#inline_event_handlers_%E2%80%94_dont_use_these)
    of why this is currently considered bad practice.

These attributes, expressed as `py-*` or `mpy-*` attributes of an HTML element,
reference the name of a Python function to run when the event is fired. You
should replace the `*` with the _actual name of an event_ (e.g. `py-click` or
`mpy-click`). This is similar to how all
[event handlers on elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#event-handlers-on-elements,-document-objects,-and-window-objects)
start with `on` in standard HTML (e.g. `onclick`). The rule of thumb is to
replace `on` with `py-` or `mpy-` and then reference the name of a
Python function.

```html title="A py-click event on an HTML button element."
<button py-click="handle_click" id="my_button">Click me!</button>
```

```python title="The related Python function."
from pyscript import window


def handle_click(event):
    """
    Simply log the click event to the browser's console.
    """
    window.console.log(event)    
```

Under the hood, the [`pyscript.when`](#pyscriptwhen) decorator is used to
enable this behaviour.

!!! note

    In earlier versions of PyScript, the value associated with the attribute
    was simply evaluated by the Python interpreter. This was unsafe:
    manipulation of the attribute's value could have resulted in the evaluation
    of arbitrary code.

    This is why we changed to the current behaviour: supply the name
    of the Python function to be evaluated, and PyScript will do this safely.
