# Terminal

In conventional (non-browser based) Python, it is common to run scripts from
the terminal, or to interact directly with the Python interpreter via the
[REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop).
It's to the terminal that `print` writes characters (via `stdout`), and it's
from the terminal that the `input` reads characters (via `stdin`).

It usually looks something like this:

<img src="../../assets/images/py-terminal.gif" style="border: 1px solid black; border-radius: 0.2rem; box-shadow: var(--md-shadow-z1);"/>

Because of the historic importance of the use of a terminal, PyScript makes one
available in the browser (based upon [XTerm.js](https://xtermjs.org/)).
As [mentioned earlier](first-steps.md), PyScript's built-in terminal is
activated with the `terminal` flag when using the `<script>`, `<py-script>` or
`<mpy-script>` tags.

    As of the 2024.4.1 release, MicroPython works with the terminal.

This is, perhaps, the simplest use case that allows data to be emitted to a
read-only terminal:

```html
<script type="py" terminal>print("hello world")</script>
```

The end result will look like this (the rectangular box indicates the current
position of the cursor):

<img src="../../assets/images/pyterm1.png" style="border: 1px solid black; border-radius: 0.2rem; box-shadow: var(--md-shadow-z1);"/>

Should you need an interactive terminal, for example because you use the
`input` statement that requires the user to type things into the terminal, you
**must ensure your code is run on a worker**:

```html
<script type="py" terminal worker>
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}")
</script>
```
<img src="../../assets/images/pyterm2.gif" style="border: 1px solid black; border-radius: 0.2rem; box-shadow: var(--md-shadow-z1);"/>

To use the interactive Python REPL in the terminal, use Python's
[code](https://docs.python.org/3/library/code.html) module like this:

```python
import code

code.interact()
```

The end result should look something like this:

<img src="../../assets/images/pyterm3.gif" style="border: 1px solid black; border-radius: 0.2rem; box-shadow: var(--md-shadow-z1);"/>

Finally, it is possible to dynamically pass Python code into the terminal. The
trick is to get a reference to the terminal created by PyScript. Thankfully,
this is very easy.

Consider this fragment:

```html
<script id="my_script" type="mpy" terminal worker></script>
```

Get a reference to the element, and call the `process` method on
that object:

```JS
const myterm = document.querySelector("#my_script");
await myterm.process('print("Hello world!")');
```

## XTerm reference

Each terminal has a reference to the
[Terminal](https://xtermjs.org/docs/api/terminal/classes/terminal/)
instance used to bootstrap the current terminal.

On the JavaScript side, it's a `script.terminal` property while on the Python
side, it's a `__terminal__` special reference that guarantees to provide the
very same `script.terminal`:

```html title="How to reach the XTerm Terminal"
<script id="py-terminal" type="py" terminal worker>
    from pyscript import document, ffi

    # example: change default font-family
    __terminal__.options = ffi.to_js({"fontFamily": "cursive"})

    script = document.getElementById("py-terminal")
    print(script.terminal == __terminal__)
    # prints True with the defined font
</script>
```

### Clear the terminal

It's very simple to clear a PyTerminal:

```html title="Clearing the terminal"
<script type="mpy" terminal worker>
    print("before")
    __terminal__.clear()
    print("after")
    # only "after" is on the terminal
</script>
```

### Terminal colors

Colors and most special characters work so you can make the text **bold** or
turn it <span style="color: green">green</span>. You could even use a control
character to `print('\033[2J')` and clear the terminal, instead of using the
exposed `clear()` method:

```html title="Terminal colors"
<script type="mpy" terminal worker>
    print("This is \033[1mbold\033[0m")
    print("This is \033[32mgreen\033[0m")
    print("This is \033[1m\033[35mbold and purple\033[0m")
</script>
```

### Terminal addons

It's possible [use XTerm.js addons](https://xtermjs.org/docs/guides/using-addons/):

```html title="Terminal addons"
<py-config>
    [js_modules.main]
    "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@xterm/addon-web-links/+esm" = "weblinks"
</py-config>
<script type="py" terminal>
    from pyscript import js_modules

    addon = js_modules.weblinks.WebLinksAddon.new()
    __terminal__.loadAddon(addon)
    
    print("Check out https://pyscript.net/")
</script>
```

By default we enable the `WebLinksAddon` addon (so URLs displayed in the
terminal automatically become links). Behind the scenes is the example code
shown above, and this approach will work for
[any other addon](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/tree/master/addons/) you
may wish to use.

### MicroPython

MicroPython has a
[very complete REPL](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/reference/repl.html)
already built into it.

  * All `Ctrl+X` strokes are handled, including paste mode and kill switches.
  * History works out of the box. Access this via the up and down arrows to
    view your command history.
  * Tab completion works like a charm. Use the `tab` key to see available
    variables or objects in `globals`.
  * Copy and paste is much improved. This is true for a single terminal entry,
    or a
    [paste mode](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/reference/repl.html#paste-mode)
    enabled variant.

As a bonus, the MicroPython terminal works on both the main thread and in
web workers, with the following caveats:

* **Main thread:**
    * Calls to the blocking `input` function are delegated to the native browser
      based
      [prompt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/prompt)
      utility.
    * There are no guards against blocking code (e.g. `while True:` loops).
      Such blocking code _could freeze your page_.
* **Web worker:**
    * Conventional support for the `input` function, without blocking the main
      thread.
    * Blocking code (e.g. `while True:` loops) does not block the main thread
      and your page will remain responsive.

We encourage the usage of `worker` attribute to bootstrap a MicroPython
terminal. But now you have an option to run the terminal in the main thread.
Remember not to block!
